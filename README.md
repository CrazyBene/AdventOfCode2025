[^aoc-footnote]:
[Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2025.
Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for
twenty-five days. This year it will only be 12 days of puzzles.
You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
